[{"UID":"11","abstract":"Mental simulation\u2014the capacity to imagine what will or what could be\u2014is a salient feature of human cognition, playing a key role in a wide range of cognitive abilities. In artificial intelligence, the last few years have seen the development of model-based deep reinforcement learning methods, which seemingly share many similarities with mental simulation. In this talk, I will discuss how closely such methods actually capture the qualitative characteristics exhibited by human mental simulation, with a particular focus on: (1) the extent to which the performance of such agents is driven by model-based reasoning and planning, and (2) how effectively such agents can leverage planning for generalization. While a number of challenges remain in matching the capacity of human mental simulation, I will highlight some recent progress on developing more compositional model-based algorithms through the use of graph neural networks and tree search.","bio":"Jessica Hamrick is a Senior Research Scientist at DeepMind, where she studies how to build machines that can flexibly build and deploy models of the world.

In the first project my collaborators and I show that a neuro-symbolic visual QA system can learn variable bindings from the top-down QA training signal only. The system successfully learns both conventional bindings (e.g. objects) and less trivial ones (e.g. groups). In our second project my colleagues at Element AI and I explore text2sql systems for answering questions about databases. We perform extensive ablation testing to understand what is really necessary for such systems to achieve best performance.

In contrast to these competitive settings, success in the real world typically requires humans, and will require AI agents, to cooperate, communicate and coordinate with others. Crucially, from a learning point of view, these three Cs require fundamentally novel approaches, methods and theory, which has been at the heart of my research agenda. In my talk I will cover recent progress, including how agents can learn to entice others to cooperate in settings of conflicting goals by accounting for their learning behaviour, how they can learn to communicate by reasoning over (public) beliefs and how they can learn policies that can coordinate with other agents at test time by exploiting the symmetries in the environment.

Machine learning models for these tasks typically rely on grounded supervision, e.g. actions paired with human-generated instructions or images paired with human-generated questions and answers. Indeed, several recent papers have argued that general-purpose language understanding (even in text-only tasks like machine reading and text generation) is impossible without grounding. In this talk, I'll present two studies on improving grounded language learning without grounded supervision. First, I'll describe an approach for using multi-agent interaction to fine-tune models for instruction following and instruction generation---without additional human-generated text. Next, I'll describe some very recent work suggesting that language models trained on text alone---without any grounding---are capable of building implicit world models and simulating interactions between entities described in discourse.","bio":"Jacob Andreas is the X Consortium Assistant Professor at MIT.

I will first highlight how we can make better lemonade out of neural language models by shifting our focus on unsupervised, inference-time algorithms. I will demonstrate how unsupervised algorithms can match or even outperform supervised approaches on hard reasoning tasks such as nonmonotonic reasoning (such as counterfactual and abductive reasoning), or complex language generation tasks that require logical constraints. Next, I will highlight the importance of melding explicit and declarative knowledge encoded in symbolic knowledge graphs with implicit and observed knowledge encoded in neural language models.

To improve multi-agent coordination, we give agents an intrinsic motivation to increase their causal influence over the actions of other agents, and show that this leads to the emergence of communication and enhances cooperation. Finally, we propose a novel Offline RL technique for learning from intrinsic social cues during interaction with humans in an open-domain dialog setting.
