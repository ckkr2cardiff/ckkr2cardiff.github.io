[{"UID":"3","abstract":"Neural language models, as they grow in scale, continue to surprise us with utterly nonsensical and counterintuitive errors despite their otherwise remarkable performances on leaderboards. In this talk, I will argue that it is time to challenge the currently dominant paradigm of task-specific supervision built on top of large-scale self-supervised neural networks. I will first highlight how we can make better lemonade out of neural language models by shifting our focus on unsupervised, inference-time algorithms. I will demonstrate how unsupervised algorithms can match or even outperform supervised approaches on hard reasoning tasks such as nonmonotonic reasoning (such as counterfactual and abductive reasoning), or complex language generation tasks that require logical constraints. Next, I will highlight the importance of melding explicit and declarative knowledge encoded in symbolic knowledge graphs with implicit and observed knowledge encoded in neural language models. I will present COMET, Commonsense Transformers that learn neural representation of commonsense reasoning from a symbolic commonsense knowledge graph, and Social Chemistry 101, a new conceptual formalism, a knowledge graph, and neural models to reason about social, moral, and ethical norms.","bio":"Yejin Choi is a Brett Helsel associate professor at the Paul G.

This talk focuses on Social Reinforcement Learning, developing new RL algorithms that leverage social learning to improve single-agent learning and generalization, multi-agent coordination, and human-AI interaction. We will demonstrate how a multi-agent technique for Adversarial Environment Generation based on minimax regret can lead to the generation of a complex curriculum of training environments, which improves an agent\u2019s zero-shot transfer to unknown, single-agent test tasks. To improve multi-agent coordination, we give agents an intrinsic motivation to increase their causal influence over the actions of other agents, and show that this leads to the emergence of communication and enhances cooperation. Finally, we propose a novel Offline RL technique for learning from intrinsic social cues during interaction with humans in an open-domain dialog setting. Together, this work argues that Social RL is a valuable approach for developing more general, sophisticated, and human-compatible AI.","bio":"Natasha Jaques holds a joint position as a Research Scientist at Google Brain and post-doc at UC Berkeley.
