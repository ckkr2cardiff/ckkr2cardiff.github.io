Unfortunately, DL ontologies are difficult to learn from data and time-consuming to encode manually. As a result, ontologies for broad domains are almost inevitably incomplete. In recent years, several data-driven approaches have been proposed for automatically extending such ontologies. One family of methods rely on characterizations of concepts that are derived from text descriptions. While such characterizations do not capture ontological knowledge directly, they encode information about the similarity between different concepts, which can be exploited for filling in the gaps in existing ontologies. To this end, several inductive inference mechanisms have already been proposed, but these have been defined and used in a heuristic fashion. In this paper, we instead propose an inductive inference mechanism which is based on a clear model-theoretic semantics, and can thus be tightly integrated with standard deductive reasoning. We particularly focus on interpolation, a powerful commonsense reasoning mechanism which is closely related to cognitive models of category-based induction. Apart from the formalization of the underlying semantics, as our main technical contribution we provide computational complexity bounds for reasoning in EL with this interpolation mechanism.","authors":"Yazm\u00edn Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez-Garc\u00eda|V\u00edctor Guti\u00e9rrez-Basulto|Steven Schockaert","proceedings":"KR","title":"Plausible Reasoning about EL-Ontologies using Concept Interpolation","type":"Conference","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14437.pdf","year":2020},{"UID":"DuboisPS17","abstract":"This paper introduces generalized possibilistic logic (GPL), a logic for epistemic reasoning based on possibility theory. Formulas in GPL correspond to propositional combinations of assertions such as \u201cit is certain to degree \u03bb that the propositional formula \u03b1 is true\u201d. As its name suggests, the logic generalizes possibilistic logic (PL), which at the syntactic level only allows conjunctions of the aforementioned type of assertions. At the semantic level, PL can only encode sets of epistemic states encompassed by a single least informed one, whereas GPL can encode any set of epistemic states. This feature makes GPL particularly suitable for reasoning about what an agent knows about the beliefs of another agent, e.g., allowing the former to draw conclusions about what the other agent does not know. We introduce an axiomatization for GPL and show its soundness and completeness w.r.t. possibilistic semantics. Subsequently, we highlight the usefulness of GPL as a powerful unifying framework for various knowledge representation formalisms. Among others, we show how comparative uncertainty and ignorance can be modelled in GPL. We also exhibit a close connection between GPL and various existing formalisms, including possibilistic logic with partially ordered formulas, a logic of conditional assertions in the style of Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor, answer set programming and a fragment of the logic of minimal belief and negation as failure. Finally, we analyse the computational complexity of reasoning in GPL, identifying decision problems at the first, second, third and fourth level of the polynomial hierarchy.","authors":"Didier Dubois|Henri Prade|Steven Schockaert","proceedings":"Artificial Intelligence","title":"Generalized possibilistic logic Foundations and applications to qualitative reasoning about uncertainty","type":"Journal","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370217300875","year":2017},{"UID":"Singleton021","abstract":"Ranking the participants of a tournament has applications in voting, paired comparisons analysis, sports and other domains. In this paper we introduce bipartite tournaments, which model situations in which two different kinds of entity compete indirectly via matches against players of the opposite kind; examples include education (students/exam questions) and solo sports (golfers/courses). In particular, we look to find rankings via chain graphs, which correspond to bipartite tournaments in which the sets of adversaries defeated by the players on one side are nested with respect to set inclusion. Tournaments of this form have a natural and appealing ranking associated with them. We apply chain editing -- finding the minimum number of edge changes required to form a chain graph -- as a new mechanism for tournament ranking. The properties of these rankings are investigated in a probabilistic setting, where they arise as maximum likelihood estimators, and through the axiomatic method of social choice theory. Despite some nice properties, two problems remain an important anonymity axiom is violated, and chain editing is NP-hard. We address both issues by relaxing the minimisation constraint in chain editing, and characterise the resulting ranking methods via a greedy approximation algorithm.","authors":"Joseph Singleton|Richard Booth","proceedings":"AAMAS","title":"Rankings for Bipartite Tournaments via Chain Editing","type":"Conference","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02476.pdf","year":2021},{"UID":"0001V21a","abstract":"The question of conditional inference, i.e., of which conditional sentences of the form ``if A then, normally, B'' should follow from a set KB of such sentences, has been one of the classic questions of AI, with several well-known solutions proposed.

Subsequent work has identified a standard translation from logic programs to (instantiated) argumentation frameworks, under which pairwise correspondences hold between various logic programming semantics and various formal argumentation semantics. This includes the correspondence between 3-valued stable and complete semantics, between well-founded and grounded semantics and between 2-valued stable (LP) and stable (argumentation) semantics. In the current paper, we show that the existing translation is able to yield the additional correspondence between ideal semantics for logic programming and ideal semantics for formal argumentation. We also show that correspondence does not hold between eager semantics for logic programming and eager semantics for formal argumentation, at least when translating from logic programming to formal argumentation.

In these graphs, an argument can be believed or disbelieved up to a given degree, thus providing a more fine\u2013grained alternative to the standard Dung's approaches when it comes to determining the status of a given argument. Furthermore, the flexibility of the epistemic approach allows us to both model the rationale behind the existing semantics as well as completely deviate from them when required. Epistemic graphs can model both attack and support as well as relations that are neither support nor attack. The way other arguments influence a given argument is expressed by the epistemic constraints that can restrict the belief we have in an argument with a varying degree of specificity. The fact that we can specify the rules under which arguments should be evaluated and we can include constraints between unrelated arguments permits the framework to be more context\u2013sensitive. It also allows for better modelling of imperfect agents, which can be important in multi\u2013agent applications.","authors":"Anthony Hunter|Sylwia Polberg|Matthias Thimm","proceedings":"Artificial Intelligence","title":"Epistemic graphs for representing and reasoning with positive and negative influences of arguments","type":"Journal","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370220300035","year":2017},{"UID":"PolbergH18","abstract":"In dialogical argumentation, it is often assumed that the involved parties will always correctly identify the intended statements posited by each other and realize all of the associated relations, conform to the three acceptability states (accepted, rejected, undecided), adjust their views whenever new and correct information comes in, and that a framework handling only attack relations is sufficient to represent their opinions. Although it is natural to make these assumptions as a starting point for further research, dropping some of them has become quite challenging. Probabilistic argumentation is one of the approaches that can be harnessed for more accurate user modelling. The epistemic approach allows us to represent how much a given argument is believed or disbelieved by a given person, offering us the possibility to express more than just three agreement states. It comes equipped with a wide range of postulates, including those that do not make any restrictions concerning how initial arguments should be viewed. Thus, this approach is potentially more suitable for handling beliefs of the people that have not fully disclosed their opinions or counterarguments with respect to standard Dung's semantics. The constellation approach can be used to represent the views of different people concerning the structure of the framework we are dealing with, including situations in which not all relations are acknowledged or when they are seen differently than intended. Finally, bipolar argumentation frameworks can be used to express both positive and negative relations between arguments. In this paper we will describe the results of an experiment in which participants were asked to judge dialogues in terms of agreement and structure. We will compare our findings with the aforementioned assumptions as well as with the constellation and epistemic approaches to probabilistic argumentation and bipolar argumentation.","authors":"Sylwia Polberg|Anthony Hunter","proceedings":"International Journal of Approximate Reasoning","title":"Empirical evaluation of abstract argumentation: Supporting the need for bipolar and probabilistic approaches","type":"Journal","url":"https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/120622/1/dialogue_paper_5_arxiv.pdf","year":2018},{"UID":"Usashi21","abstract":"Dietary practices are governed by a mix of ethnographic aspects, such as social, cultural and environmental factors.
